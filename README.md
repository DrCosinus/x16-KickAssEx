# VSCode KickAssEx (Commander X16)

Visual Studio Code language support for Commander X16 development with [Kick Assembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/) thanks to its support of 65C02.

This is a fork of [x16-kickass](https://github.com/Vrokin/x16-KickAss), made by [Niko Vanraes aka Vrokin](https://github.com/Vrokin).
Thanks to Niko !

I'd like to add my voice to Niko's thanks.
[x16-kickass](https://github.com/Vrokin/x16-KickAss) was heavily inspired by :
- the [Sublime KickAssembler (C64)](https://github.com/Swoffa/SublimeKickAssemblerC64) package, 
- the [vscode-kickassembler](https://github.com/tomconte/vscode-kickassembler), made by [Thomas Cont√©](https://github.com/tomconte),
- the [vscode-kickass-c64](https://github.com/CaptainJiNX/vscode-kickass-c64), made by [Captain JiNX](https://github.com/CaptainJiNX/).
Thanks to all of you !

Thanks also to [JimJimPlays and his Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVxS1_x-Ygd7O9Z-d0Kjk0A) and his "Beginning Assembly" tutorials. And finally thanks to [The 8-bit guy](http://www.the8bitguy.com) for his [Commander X16](https://www.commanderx16.com) "Dream computer" project.
His videos and his "neo-retro" computer project brought me back to the Commodore world of my childhood and the unfulfilled, until today, curiousity in how it worked behind the scenes.

Comments & feedback are welcome!
Also, if you would like some options or features, let me know. 

## Features
